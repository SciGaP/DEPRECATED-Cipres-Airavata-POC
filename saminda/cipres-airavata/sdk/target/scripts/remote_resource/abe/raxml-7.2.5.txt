 Terri,

Per our discussion today, the logic needs to be modified slightly to
accommodate bootstopping, i.e., when -N autoyy is specified, where
autoyy is not a number.  The changes are flagged in the appended
message by **s.

Regards,  Wayne

When -N nnn -x xxx -f a is specified **with nnn a number**, check the
number of characters (nchar)

>in the PHYLIP file, or ask the user to input that separately.

When -N nnn is specified **with nnn a number**, the hybrid code code is
