I think Paul created this directory, but the .svn directory on tscc in 
~ngbw/contrib/scripts points to the "triton" remote_resources directory 
and that's where the latest versions, that are actually in use on tscc, are committed.

That's why I renamed this directory tscc_not_really_used.  I should rename "triton"
to "tscc" and check it out on tscc ~/ngbw/contrib/scripts.
