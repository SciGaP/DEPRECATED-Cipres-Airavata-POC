<h3>Swami, The Next Generation Biology Workbench</h3>
<p>
	Welcome to the Next generation Biology Workbench, Version 0.9. This is a draft release for
	public comment and suggestions. The current interface reflects our best efforts to create a
	resource that is easy to use, and can accomplish many different kinds of tasks. The toolkit
	is small today, but will grow quickly. We expect to release most of the tools of the current
	Biology Workbench in December or early January, along with new databases.

	The Next Generation Biology Workbench is a free resource for research and education in
	Bioinformatics, Genomics, Proteomics, and Phylogenetics. The conceptual basis for NGBW
	is the <a href="http://workbench.sdsc.edu/">Biology Workbench</a>. It has been re-engineered
	here using best practices from industry and academia to provide high performance analytical
	tools to the research and education communities. It is designed to be an organic tool that
	evolves with the needs of the community.
