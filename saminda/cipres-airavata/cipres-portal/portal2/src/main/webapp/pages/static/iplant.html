			The <a href="http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/">iPlant Collaborative</a> is a large NSF-funded 
			project that provides users with access to a wide variety of software tools and capabilities, as 
			well as access to a large number of biological databases. Users can access these resources through 
			the <a href="http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/discover/discovery-environment">iPlant Discovery Environment</a> 
			(DE), a flexible and innovative web client. The login tab presented here allows users who are registered 
			with the iPlant Collaborative to work both in the iPlant DE, and in the CIPRES Science Gateway, through 
			a single-login mechanism. We encourage our users to visit the iPlant DE page, and to register and test 
			drive the application. If you have further questions, <a href="javascript:popupWithSizes('https://www.ngbw.org/ngbugz/default.php?pg=pgPublicEdit',800,600,'1')">please 
			let us know.</p>
