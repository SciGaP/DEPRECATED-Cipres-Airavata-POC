Handling upload of big files on cipres portal and things I learned about
struts and our web app along the way:

1) cipres-portal - actions - CreateData.java: for both single file and applet case,
don't read into memory (i.e. looked for getEncodedData() and got rid of it).  Made
saveDataItem() use stream instead of String.

2) In resources/conversion/conversionRegistry.xml made MackSourceDocumentReader the reader
for everything.  This makes Workbench.canRead() return false.   Otherwise the call to
DataManager.refreshFolderDataTabs() at the end of CreateData.saveDataItems() will read
the file into memory.

	The actual flow is Workbench.canRead() calls DefaultConversionService.canRead(SourceDocumentType)
	calls DefaultConversionRegistry.hasReader(SourceDocumentType) which returns false for 
	MockSourceDocumentReader.

	sdk.core.shared.SourceDocumentType is the triplet: EntityType, DataType, DataFormat, which
	are enums defined in sdk.core.types. RecordType is also an enum, it corresponds to a combo
	of EntityType and DataType.

	UserDataItem is a SourceDocument (which is just an interface) and it contains a SourceDocumentRow.  
	It also has info about the data type triple, the owner, a list of records, etc.  While a SourceDocumentRow
	just has an id, a length and a FileColumn (a type of column that stores the data in a file outside
	the db).

3) Keep in mind that exceptions that occur during OGNL (and I think JSTL) expression evaluation
are silently eaten.  Part of the page may be missing, but you'll never see anything in a log
file and it won't reach any struts configured exception handling code.  For example, when a
property getter in DataManager.java, like isCurrentTabPhysical() throws an exception, all that we
see is that some of the columns are missing.  Apparently this is by design and there's nothing
you can do about it except to catch and log exceptions in the property getter methods themselves.

4) Size of "Use Data" table is hardcoded in cipres.css. See ".list".  When fields get
too long they wrap.


TODO:
- get rid of all the JUpload parameter struts warnings in the log when using the applet.  Stack
traces really clutter the log.
